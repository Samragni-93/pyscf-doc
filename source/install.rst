.. _installing:

Installation
************

Installation with pip
=====================

This is the recommended way to install PySCF::

  $ pip install pyscf

Pypi provides a precompiled PySCF code (python wheel) which works on almost all
Linux systems, and most of Mac OS X systems, and the ubuntu subsystems on Windows 10.
If you already have pyscf installed, you can upgrade it to the new version::

  $ pip install --upgrade pyscf

Since PySCF-2.0, some modules were developed indepently as :ref:`installing_extproj`.
Individual extension module (for example the geometry optimization module) can
be installed using pip extra dependency::

  $ pip install pyscf[geomopt]

Command to install all extension modules::

  $ pip install pyscf[all]

Extension modules can be found in `https://github.com/pyscf` (see also :ref:`installing_extproj`).
To install the latest version of the extension modules from github, github repo
url with prefix `git+` can be placed in the argument list of pip command::

  $ pip install git+https://github.com/pyscf/geomopt


Pip install the latest code on github
-------------------------------------
The latest code on github can be installed::

  $ pip install git+https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf

To install the features developed on a particular branch::

  $ pip install git+https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf@<branch_name>

This install method compiles and links C extensions against the libraries in
your system. It requires Cmake, BLAS library and GCC compiler (more detalis of
prerequisites can be found :ref:`compile_c_extensions`). The C extensions are
compiled with default settings specified in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. If you
would like to tune the cmake compilation parameters, you can set the environment
envariable `CMAKE_CONFIGURE_ARGS`. The contents of this environment variable
will be completely passed to cmake command. For example, if you have multiple
BLAS libraries available in your system and MKL is the one you would like to
use, you can sepcify the environment variable (see also :ref:`installing_blas`)::

  $ export CMAKE_CONFIGURE_ARGS="-DBLA_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp_seq"


Installation on Fedora
======================

If you are running Fedora Linux, you can install PySCF as a distribution package::

  # dnf install python3-pyscf

If you are running on an X86-64 platform, dnf should automatically
install the optimized integral library, qcint, instead of the
cross-platform libcint library.

Extension modules are not available in the Fedora package.

Installation with conda
=======================

If you have `Conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`_
(or `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads#linux>`_)
environment, PySCF package can be installed with Conda cloud::

  $ conda install -c pyscf pyscf

Extension modules are not available on conda cloud. They should be installed
with pip command or through environment variable `PYSCF_EXT_PATH` (see the
section :ref:`installing_extproj`).


PySCF docker image
==================

The following command starts a container with the jupyter notebook server
listening for HTTP connections on port 8888::

  $ docker run -it -p 8888:8888 pyscf/pyscf:latest

Then visit ``https://localhost:8888`` with your browser to use notebook and
pyscf.

Another way to use PySCF in docker container is to start an Ipython shell::

  $ docker run -it pyscf/pyscf:latest start.sh ipython


.. _compile_c_extensions:
Compiling from source code
==========================

Prerequisites for manual install are

* Cmake >= 3.10
* Python >= 3.6
* Numpy >= 1.13
* Scipy >= 0.19
* h5py >= 2.7

You can download the latest PySCF (or the development branch) from github::

  $ git clone https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf.git
  $ cd pyscf
  $ git checkout dev  # optional if you'd like to try out the development branch

Build the C extensions in :file:`pyscf/lib`::

  $ cd pyscf/lib
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

This will automatically download the analytical GTO integral library `libcint
<https://github.com/sunqm/libcint.git>`_ and the DFT exchange correlation
functional libraries `Libxc <http://www.tddft.org/programs/Libxc>`_ and `XCFun
<https://github.com/dftlibs/xcfun.git>`_.  Finally, to make Python find the
`pyscf` package, add the top-level `pyscf` directory (not the `pyscf/pyscf`
subdirectory) to `PYTHONPATH`.  For example, if `pyscf` is installed in
``/opt``, `PYTHONPATH` should be like::

  export PYTHONPATH=/opt/pyscf:$PYTHONPATH

To ensure the installation is successful, start a Python shell, and type::

  >>> import pyscf

For Mac OS X/macOS, you may get an import error if your OS X/macOS version is
10.11 or newer::

    OSError: dlopen(xxx/pyscf/pyscf/lib/libcgto.dylib, 6): Library not loaded: libcint.3.0.dylib
    Referenced from: xxx/pyscf/pyscf/lib/libcgto.dylib
    Reason: unsafe use of relative rpath libcint.3.0.dylib in xxx/pyscf/pyscf/lib/libcgto.dylib with restricted binary

This is caused by the incorrect RPATH.  Script
``pyscf/lib/_runme_to_fix_dylib_osx10.11.sh`` in ``pyscf/lib`` directory can be
used to fix this problem::

    cd pyscf/lib
    sh _runme_to_fix_dylib_osx10.11.sh

.. note::

  RPATH has been built in the dynamic library.  This may cause library loading
  error on some systems.  You can run ``pyscf/lib/_runme_to_remove_rpath.sh`` to
  remove the rpath code from the library head.  Another workaround is to set
  ``-DCMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=1`` and ``-DCMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH=0`` in cmake command line.
  When the RPATH was removed, you need to add ``pyscf/lib`` and
  ``pyscf/lib/deps/lib`` in ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``.



Environment variables and global configures
===========================================

----------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
Env variable            Comments
----------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
`PYSCF_MAX_MEMORY`      Maximum memory to use (in MB)
`PYSCF_TMPDIR`          Directory to put temporary files
`PYSCF_CONFIG_FILE`     A file with various pyscf default settings
`PYSCF_EXT_PATH`        Path of external extensions
----------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------

`PYSCF_MAX_MEMORY` sets the default maximum memory (in MB) when creating `Mole`
(or `Cell`) object. It corresponds to the attribute `max_memory``of Mole` (or
`Cell`) object.

The environment variable `PYSCF_TMPDIR` controls which directory to put
intermediates and temporary data when running pyscf. If this environment
variable is not set, the system-wide temporary directory `TMPDIR` will be used
as the scratch directory. It's highly recommended to set this variable to a
directory with enough disk space. Many quantum chemistry methods consume a huge
amount of temporary storage space.

`PYSCF_CONFIG_FILE` is a python file that predefines default parameters in the
program. You may noticed the statements `getattr(__config__, "FOOBAR")` many
places in the source code. These global parameters are defined in
`PYSCF_CONFIG_FILE` and loaded during the pyscf module was imported.
By default, this environment variable points to `~/.pyscf_conf.py`.

`PYSCF_EXT_PATH` allows you to include PySCF extensions with the package. Please
find detail document in :ref:`installing_extproj`.


.. _installing_wo_network:
Installation without network
============================

External libraries (libcint, libxc, xcfun) will be downloaded and installed when
compiling the C extensions. This section shows how to install the external
libraries without accessing to network. First, you need to install libcint,
Libxc and XCFun libraries::

    $ git clone https://github.com/sunqm/libcint.git
    $ tar czf libcint.tar.gz libcint

    $ wget https://gitlab.com/libxc/libxc/-/archive/4.3.4/libxc-4.3.4.tar.gz

    $ git clone https://github.com/sunqm/xcfun.git
    $ tar czf xcfun.tar.gz xcfun

Assuming ``/opt`` is the place where these libraries will be installed, these
packages should be compiled with the flags::

    $ tar xvzf libcint.tar.gz
    $ cd libcint
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DWITH_F12=1 -DWITH_RANGE_COULOMB=1 -DWITH_COULOMB_ERF=1 \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR:PATH=lib ..
    $ make && make install

    $ tar xvzf libxc-4.3.4.tar.gz
    $ cd libxc-4.3.4
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1 \
        -DENABLE_FORTRAN=0 -DDISABLE_KXC=0 -DDISABLE_LXC=1 \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR:PATH=lib ..
    $ make && make install

    $ tar xvzf xcfun.tar.gz
    $ cd xcfun
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1 -DXC_MAX_ORDER=3 -DXCFUN_ENABLE_TESTS=0 \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR:PATH=lib ..
    $ make && make install

Next, compile PySCF::

    $ cd pyscf/pyscf/lib
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DBUILD_LIBCINT=0 -DBUILD_LIBXC=0 -DBUILD_XCFUN=0 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt ..
    $ make

Finally update the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment for Python interpreter.


.. _installing_blas:
Using optimized BLAS
====================

The default installation tries to find BLAS libraries automatically. This
automated setup script may link the code to slow BLAS libraries.  You can
compile the package with other BLAS vendors to improve performance, for example
the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), which can provide 10x speedup in many
modules::

  $ cd pyscf/lib/build
  $ cmake -DBLA_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp_seq ..
  $ make

When linking the program to MKL library, for some MKL versions, cmake may have
problems to find the correct MKL libraries.  Setting ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to
include the MKL dynamic libraries sometimes can help cmake to find the MKL
libraries, e.g.::

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2018/linux/mkl/lib/intel64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If you are using Anaconda as your Python-side platform, you can link PySCF
to the MKL library coming with Anaconda package::

  $ export MKLROOT=/path/to/anaconda2
  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MKLROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $ cd pyscf/lib/build
  $ cmake -DBLA_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp_seq ..
  $ make

You can link to other BLAS libraries by setting ``BLA_VENDOR``, eg
``BLA_VENDOR=ATLAS``, ``BLA_VENDOR=IBMESSL``, ``BLA_VENDOR=OpenBLAS`` (requiring cmake-3.6).
Please refer to `cmake mannual <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.6/module/FindBLAS.html>`_
for more details of the use of ``FindBLAS`` macro.

If the cmake ``BLA_VENDOR`` cannot find the right BLAS library as you expected,
you can assign the libraries to the variable ``BLAS_LIBRARIES`` in
:file:`lib/CMakeLists.txt`::

  set(BLAS_LIBRARIES "${BLAS_LIBRARIES};/path/to/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_intel_lp64.so")
  set(BLAS_LIBRARIES "${BLAS_LIBRARIES};/path/to/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_sequential.so")
  set(BLAS_LIBRARIES "${BLAS_LIBRARIES};/path/to/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_core.so")
  set(BLAS_LIBRARIES "${BLAS_LIBRARIES};/path/to/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_avx.so")

.. note::
  MKL library may lead to an OSError at runtime:
  ``OSError: ... mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_avx.so: undefined symbol: ownLastTriangle_64fc``
  or ``MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load libmkl_avx.so or libmkl_def.so.``.
  It can be solved by preloading MKL core library with:
  ``export LD_PRELOAD=$MKLROOT/lib/intel64/libmkl_avx.so:$MKLROOT/lib/intel64/libmkl_core.so``


.. _installing_qcint:
Using optimized integral library
================================

The default integral library used by PySCF is
libcint (https://github.com/sunqm/libcint).  This integral library was
implemented in the model that ensures the compatibility on various high
performance computer systems.  For X86-64 platforms, libcint library has an
efficient counterpart Qcint (https://github.com/sunqm/qcint)
which is heavily optimized against X86 SIMD instructions (AVX-512/AVX2/AVX/SSE3).
To replace the default libcint library with qcint library, edit the URL
of the integral library in lib/CMakeLists.txt file::

  ExternalProject_Add(libcint
     GIT_REPOSITORY
     https://github.com/sunqm/qcint.git
     ...


Cmake config file
=================
Cmake options can be saved in a config file ``pyscf/lib/cmake.arch.inc``.
Settings in this config file will be automatically loaded and overwritten the
default cmake options during compilation.  For example, you can put
``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` in this config file to include advanced compiler optimization
flags::

  set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -ffast-math -mtune=native -march=native")

Other settings and variables and flags can all be put in this config file::

  set(ENABLE_XCFUN Off)
  set(WITH_F12 Off)

Some examples of platform specific configurations can be found in directory
``pyscf/lib/cmake_arch_config``.


.. _installing_extproj:
Extension modules
=================
Since PySCF-2.0, some modules were moved from the main code trunk to extension
projects hosted in https://github.com/pyscf.

------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------

Based on the technique of namespace
pacakges specified in `PEP 420 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/>`,
PySCF developed a couple of methods to install the extension modules.

* Pypi command. For pypi version newer than 19.0, projects that are hosted on
  github can be installed in command line::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/pyscf/semiemprical

  A particular release on github can be installed with the release URL you found
  on github::

    $ pip install https://github.com/pyscf/semiemprical/archive/v0.1.0.tar.gz

* Pypi command for local paths. If you wish to load an extension module developed
  in a local directory, you can use the local install mode of pip. In this way,
  it is recommended to operate in the python virtual environment so that changes
  you made do not pollute the system default python runtime environment. For
  example::

    $ python -m venv /home/abc/pyscf-local-env
    $ source /home/abc/pyscf-local-env/bin/activate
    $ git clone https://github.com/pyscf/semiemprical /home/abc/semiemprical
    $ pip install -e /home/abc/semiemprical

* Environment variable `PYSCF_EXT_PATH`. You can put the location of each
  extension module or a file that contains these locations in this environment
  varialbe. PySCF library will parse the paths defined in this environment
  variable and load the relevent submodules. For example::

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyscf/semiemprical /home/abc/semiemprical
    $ git clone https://github.com/pyscf/doci /home/abc/doci
    $ git clone https://github.com/pyscf/dftd3 /home/abc/dftd3
    $ echo /home/abc/doci >> /home/abc/.pyscf_ext_modules
    $ echo /home/abc/dftd3 >> /home/abc/.pyscf_ext_modules
    $ export PYSCF_EXT_PATH=/home/abc/semiemprical:/home/abc/.pyscf_ext_modules

  Using the so-defined environment variable `PYSCF_EXT_PATH`, three extension
  submodules (semiemprical, doci, dftd3) will be loaded when pyscf was imported.
  In this way, you don't have to use the python virtual environment.

Once the extension modules are correctly installed (with any methods shown
above), you can use them as the regular submodules developed inside the pyscf
main project::

    >>> import pyscf
    >>> from pyscf.semiemprical import MINDO
    >>> mol = pyscf.M(atom='N 0 0 0; N 0 0 1')
    >>> MINDO(mol).run()


NAO
---
The :mod:`nao` module includes the basic functions of numerical atomic orbitals
(NAO) and the (nao based) TDDFT methods.  This module was contributed by Marc
Barbry and Peter Koval. More details of :mod:`nao` can be found in
https://github.com/pyscf/nao/blob/master/README.md. This module can be installed::

    $ pip install https://github.com/pyscf/nao


DMRG solver
-----------
Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) implementations Block
(https://sanshar.github.io/Block) and
CheMPS2 (http://sebwouters.github.io/CheMPS2/index.html)
are efficient DMRG solvers for ab initio quantum chemistry problem.
`Installing Block <https://sanshar.github.io/Block/build.html>`_ requires
C++11 compiler.  If C++11 is not supported by your compiler, you can
register and download the precompiled Block binary from
https://sanshar.github.io/Block/build.html.
Before using the Block or CheMPS2, you need create a configuration file
``pyscf/dmrgscf/settings.py``  (as shown by settings.py.example) to store
the path where the DMRG solver was installed.


TBLIS
-----
`TBLIS <https://github.com/devinamatthews/tblis>`_ provides a native algorithm
to perform tensor contraction for arbitrary high dimensional tensors. The native
algorithm does not need to transform tensors into matrices then call the BLAS
libraries for the matrix contraction.  Tensor transposing and data moving are
largely avoided in TBLIS tensor library.  The interface to TBLIS offers an
efficient implementation for :func:`numpy.einsum` style tensor contraction.
The tlibs-einsum plugin can be enabled::

  $ pip install pyscf-tblis
